**COMP 3005 Assignment 3 Question 1**
*How to Run*
1. Download the .ZIP file and unzip
2. Open PGAdmin4
3. In PGAdmin4, create a new Database called "A3Q1"
4. Right click the database, and press "Restore"
5. When selecting the file, select the A3Q1.sql file provided in the src folder
6. Under the Schema/View Tab, use the Student View to be able to view the database, this is what the database looks like at the start with the provided intial data
7. Open the IDE of your choice (I used VSCode) Note: The IDE must be able to run a Python file, .py
8. Open the Assignment3Q1.py file
9. Run the code
10. When prompted in the terminal, enter the password set up for PGAdmin4 (user dependent)
11. The application will execute all 4 functions, displaying the information of each query into the terminal, seperated with other print statements to allow for easier reading
12. To check if the changes to effect, open PGAdmin4 and refresh the Student view that you used in step 6
13. Changes made by the application will have changed the database
